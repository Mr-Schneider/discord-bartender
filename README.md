## Deployment

This is currently written to deploy to Google Cloud using Google App Engine. It could esily be modified to run another way.

### Config File

To start, fill in `config.json`:
```
{
	"prefix": "!",
	"token": "[DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN]"
}
```

Whether self hosted or in "the cloud" you will need to set up a firebase project tied to your google cloud project. Firestore is the databse used in this project so that will need to be set up in your project.

### GCP

To deploy, sign into the gcloud cli.

Sign in with a user account `gcloud auth login` or if you have a service account file, `gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file [KEY_FILE]`

Once authenticated, `gcloud app deploy --promote --stop-previous-version --version=<version name> --quiet`

This will deploy with only one version tag, and due to the app.yml there will only be one instance, so every time you deploy your newest version will be the only version running. If you get too many different versions, you can use the `clean` script to clean them up `clean <service (usually "default")> <# of versions to keep>`

### Self Hosted

Run run locally, simply change (in `server.js`):
```
admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.applicationDefault()
});
```

To:
```
let serviceAccount = require('[KEY_FILE]');

admin.initializeApp({
  credential: admin.credential.cert(serviceAccount)
});
```

Then you can start the server
```
node server.js
```
